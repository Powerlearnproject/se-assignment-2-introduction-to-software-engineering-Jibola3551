Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: Software engineering can be defined as a process that deals with designing,developing,testing and maintenance of software application.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? Software engineering is a discipline within engineering that partain to the development of software products through the application pf clearly defined principles,methodologies and processes
software engineering differs from traditonal programmig because software engineering emcompasses the entire lifecycle of the sofware from inception to maintenance , highlighting a methoddical and structured approach to software development while programming ia all about the code 
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1.Requirement: This phase involve gathering and analyzing requirement from stakeholders. this means developers work closely with clients in order to understand what the software should accomplish, its functionality and any specific needs 
2. Planning; this is the phase where project manager create a well detailed plan outlining the scope, resources, timeline and budget for the project
3. Design: it's during this phase architects and designers create the software architecture and design its component
4. Implementation: this involves converting the design into a language that computer can understand. At this stage tasks are splits into modules nd given to different developers to build the system. Its the longest phase which requires coding guidelines and programming tools
5. Testing: this is the fifth stage after software is buily, it is deployed for testing. The testing team checks if it works as per customer requirement. Bugs found are fixed by developers and re-tested until the softwareis stable and bug free
6. DEPLOYMENT: This stage involves releasing the product for customer use after the testing. Deployment complexity depends on projectsize
7. Maintenace: thisis the last stage where the developed product is being taking care of. The software is updated timely according to the changing in user and technology.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirement Engineering is the process of eliciting the needs and desire of stakeholders and transforming them ito a mutually agreed upon set of detailed requirements which can subsequently serve as the foundation for all development activities
Process of Requirement Engineering;
1. Elicit Requirement: Elicitation entails acquainting oneself with all crucial project details. The client will disclose their requirements and offer essential background information. It is imperative to thoroughly examine these details and gain insight into analogous software solutions.This stage yields vital context for development.
2. Analysis Requirement:The aim is to analyze and enhance the collected requirements. its a development of models such as data flow diagrams (DFDs) and entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs).
3. Specification Requirement:This involves the gathering of functional and non functional project requirements during the specification phase. V arious tools such as data flow diagrams are utilized at this stage to enhance the clarity of the project goals.
4. Validation Requirement: This involves ensuring the requirement meet quality criteria like feasibility, consistency and completeness
5. Requirement Management: This is the process that operates concurrently with the previously outlined processes. Within this management, there is an emphasis on aligning all relevant processes with their respective requirements. It involves the analysis, documentation, and prioritization of requirements, as well as communication with pertinent stakeholders. Any necessary modifications to requirements are addressed in an effective and systematic fashion.
Requirement Engineering importance in Software development life cycle:
1. Foundation for Development: Requirements are crucial for the success of any software development project. Clear and precise requirements are essential for developers to understand what they need to build.
2. Improved Quality: Well-defined requirements help to prevent defects and rework, resulting in higher-quality software.
3. Cost and Time Efficiency: Proper requirement engineering can save time and money by catching issues early on and preventing costly changes and delays.
4. Stakeholder Satisfaction: Involving stakeholders in the requirement process ensures that their needs are met, leading to greater satisfaction with the final product.
5. Scope Management: Clear requirements help to define the project scope and prevent scope creep, making it easier to manage changes.
6. Risk Reduction: Early identification and analysis of requirements help to identify and mitigate potential risks before they impact the project.
7. Documentation and Communication: Detailed requirement documentation is important for consistent communication among team members and stakeholders throughout the project.
8. Compliance and Standards: Requirement engineering ensures that the software meets industry standards, regulations, and organizational policies.

Software Design Principles:
Refrence: "Software Requirements" by Karl Wiegers and Joy Beatty
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design refers to the practice of breaking down a system into smaller, self-contained modules or components that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently. These modules typically encapsulate a specific functionality or feature of the software.
Ways in which modularity in software design improve maintaianability and scalability of software systems are;
Encapsulation
Ease of maintenance
 Code reusability
Scalability
Parallel development
 Testing

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
The different levels of software testing are;
Unit Testing: In this type of testing, errors are detected individually from every component or unit by individually testing the components or units of software to ensure that they are fit for use by the developers. It is the smallest testable part of the software.
Integration Testing: In this testing, two or more modules which are unit tested are integrated to test i.e., technique interacting components, and are then verified if these integrated modules work as per the expectation or not, and interface errors are also detected.
System Testing: In system testing, complete and integrated Softwares are tested i.e., all the system elements forming the system are tested as a whole to meet the requirements of the system.
Acceptance Testing: This is a kind of testing conducted to ensure that the requirements of the users are fulfilled before its delivery and that the software works correctly in the user’s working environment.
Reference; level of software testing, https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/levels-of-software-testing/
Software testing is crucial in software development because it helps to;
Identify and remove errors.
Ensure software works as intended.
Improve quality, security, and reliability.
Optimize performance and usability.
Build customer trust and brand reputation.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control, also known as versioning or source control, is the practice of managing changes to source code. It’s about keeping a detailed account of every modification made to the code, ensuring that these changes are both trackable and reversible.
Reasons why version control is important to both software developers and product/project managers:

Streamlined release management: One key advantage of version control is its facilitation of release management. It helps in maintaining different versions of software releases. These releases encapsulate various enhancements and features developed for different customers, aligning with the release roadmap.

Conflict prevention
Version control helps avoid code conflicts within the source code base. By maintaining separate branches for different releases, it minimizes the chance of changes overlapping and causing conflicts.

Tracking changes to digital artifacts
In addition to source code, version control helps track changes to other digital artifacts involved in software development. This could include technical design specifications, requirement documents, or any other deliverables that may be subject to multiple iterations.
Examples of popular version of control system and their features:

SVN — SVN, short for Subversion, is a centralized version control tool. While it’s more advanced than local version control, it carries a risk: if the central repository becomes corrupted, it’s difficult to retract the changes.

TFS — Team Foundation Server (TFS) by Microsoft is also a centralized version control system, sharing the same limitations as SVN. When coupled with Azure DevOps, however, it can work with GIT to provide a distributed version control system.

Mercurial — This open-source, distributed version control system is preferred over TFS and SVN because it mirrors the central repository and history in each local repository, preventing total loss of information and data corruption

Git — Git is a distributed repository version control system similar to Mercurial. It comes coupled with GitLab (a repository management software) and GitHub (a platform to upload copies of the repository)

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is an integral part of the software life cycle that involves modifying and updating software after it has been deployed. The goal of maintenance is to correct faults, improve performance or other attributes, and adapt the software to a changing environment throughout its lifetime.

Types of maintenance activities;
Adaptive software maintenance: Tech teams perform adaptive maintenance to adapt their existing software to changing business needs and development environments. It helps companies ensure that the software can keep up with these changes and continue functioning correctly.

Corrective software maintenance: is undertaken to fix software errors like poor database design, bugs, viruses, security vulnerabilities, etc. However, corrective maintenance should not be confused with problem-solving; Because here, the goal is to fix the errors, not to design new solutions.Usually, corrections come from user-generated bug reports, but corrective software maintenance can help to spot them in advance.

Preventive software maintenance: it keeps your software functioning efficiently in the long run. It focuses on reducing the deterioration risk of your software and improves its scalability and reliability in the future.Preventive maintenance includes activities like code optimization, revised documentation, code refactoring, database performance management, anti-virus protection, etc.

Perfective software maintenance: The goal of perfective maintenance is to enhance the overall performance and usability of the software. Tech teams perform perfective software maintenance to modify features, elements, and user interfaces to suit the evolving business goals and the expectations of the end users.
Reference: Hiren Dhaduk Feb 1, 2023- https://www.simform.com/blog/software-maintenance/

Maintenance is esstiential in software is essential in software lifecycle because it ensure it continues to function as it was designed to and repairs or upgrades are performed as needed
